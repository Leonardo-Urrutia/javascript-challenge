# javascript-challenge

In this challenge, I have a dataset of UFO sightings from the daterange 1/1/2010 - 1/13/2020. With DOM manipulation, I display the data in my index.html file.
There is an input form where you can type in a date within the dataset, and the table will update with the desired search date.
