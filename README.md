# javascript-challenge

In this challenge, I have a dataset of UFO sightings from the date range 1/1/2010 - 1/13/2020. With DOM manipulation, I display the data in my index.html file.
There is an input form where you can type in a date within the dataset, and the table will update with the desired search date.

Level-1 contains full working code with one user input triggered filter on table data. Level-2 will have multiple user input filter options, but not yet completed. With current workload, this action item will be expected to be completed around mid Q1 2021.
